In this work, we explore the use of feudal\n        networks, used in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), to devise a\n        vehicle agent to predict steering angles from first person, dash-cam images\n        of the Udacity driving dataset. Our method,Feudal Steering, is inspired by\n        recent work in HRL consisting of a manager network and a worker network that\n        operate on different temporal scales and have different goals. The manager works\n        at a temporal scale that is relatively coarse compared to the worker and has a\n        higher level, task-oriented goal space. Using feudal learning to divide the task into\n        manager and worker sub-networks provides more accurate and robust prediction. Temporal\n        abstraction in driving allows more complex primitives than the steering angle at a single\n        time instance. Composite actions comprise a subroutine or skill that can be re-used\n        throughout the driving sequence. The associated subroutine id is the manager network’s\n        goal, so that the manager seeks to succeed at the high level task (e.g. a sharp right\n        turn, a slight right turn, moving straight in traffic, or moving straight unencumbered\n        by traffic). The steering angle at a particular time instance is the worker network\n        output which is regulated by the manager’s high level task. We demonstrate\n        state-of-the art steering angle prediction results on the Udacity dataset.\n      </p>\n      <h1>Oral Presentation</h1>\n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUbhBZTb3j4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen> </iframe>\n      <div> <p> </p></div>\n      <h1> Network </h1>\n      <img src={`${PUBLIC_URL}/images/publications/Sub_Angle_Diagram.png`} alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" />\n      <p>\n        This is our Feudal Steering network.

The input to the worker network is a sequence of m frames,\n        [i<sub>n−m</sub>, i<sub>n−(m−1)</sub>, ..., i<sub>n</sub>], a goal,\n        g, obtained from the manager network, and the previous steering angle, a<sub>n−1</sub>.\n        The yellow box represents the ELU (exponential linear unit) and group normalization step\n        in the pipeline.\n      </p>\n    </article>\n  </Main>\n);\n\nexport default Contact;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
