Using drone imaging, we develop a\n        framework for characterizing the ripening process of cranberry crops. Our method consists\n        of drone-based time-series collection over a cranberry growing season, photometric\n        calibration for albedo recovery from pixels, and berry segmentation with semi-supervised\n        deep learning networks using point-click annotations. By extracting time-series berry\n        albedo measurements, we evaluate four different varieties of cranberries and provide a\n        quantification of their ripening rates. Such quantification has practical implications\n        for 1) assessing real-time overheating risks for cranberry bogs; 2) large scale comparisons\n        of progeny in crop breeding; 3) detecting disease by looking for ripening pattern outliers.\n        This work is the first of its kind in quantitative evaluation of ripening using computer\n        vision methods and has impact beyond cranberry crops including wine grapes, olives,\n        blueberries, and maize.\n      </p>\n    </article>\n  </Main>\n);\n\nexport default Contact;\n"],"names":["_jsx","Main","title","description","children","_jsxs","className","id","Link","to","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
