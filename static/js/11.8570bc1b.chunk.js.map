I&apos;m an NSF Fellow on the\n        <a href=\"https://robotics.rutgers.edu/\"> SOCRATES NRT</a>.\n        My advisor is <a href=\"https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~kdana/\"> Professor Kristin Dana</a>.\n        Before that, I got my bachelor&apos;s degree in Electrical and Computer\n        Engineering also from Rutgers University.\n      </p>\n      <h3> Research </h3>\n      <p>\n        My current research focus deals with socially cognizant robotic navigation,\n        social behavior characterization, and human-robot interaction under the\n        <a href=\"https://robotics.rutgers.edu/\"> SOCRATES NSF NRT</a>. Stay tuned\n        for more details!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        My previous work deals with autonomous vehicle steering angle prediction.\n        We created a network,\n        <a href=\"https://fmjohnson97.github.io/feudal-steering/\"> Feudal Steering</a>,\n        that uses hierarchical networks to exploit the temporal abstraction inherent\n        in driving tasks to make predicting steering angles from dash-cam images easier.\n      </p>\n      <h3> Internships </h3>\n      <p>\n        I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work on several different\n        projects with other teams. At <a href=\"https://www.sri.com/computer-vision/\"> SRI International </a>\n        in 2020, I created baseline agents for the\n        <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/machine-common-sense\"> DARPA Machine Common Sense </a>\n        project.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/#research-area\"> Nvidia </a> in 2021,\n        I created an oracle network to produce semantic segmentation pseudo-labels for\n        previously unseen data to reduce overall datatset labeling costs.\n      </p>\n      <h3> Other Projects </h3>\n      <p>\n        At Rutgers, I started the\n        <a href=\"https://fmjohnson97.github.io/n2eRobotics/\"> N2E Robotics Club </a>\n        where students teach hour long modules on robotics topics (computer vision, control\n        algos, ML, 3D printing, CAD, ROS, etc) to each other in a non-intimidating\n        environment from the ground up. The goal is to tear down the barrier to entry\n        for robotics so that it can be accessible for more people.\n      </p>\n      <h3> Teaching </h3>\n      <p>\n        I&apos;ve TA-ed for the following courses in the Rutgers ECE department:\n        <ul>\n          <li>Professionalism and Ethics - S&apos;20</li>\n          <li>Probability and Random Processes - S&apos;21</li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n    </article>\n  </Main>\n);\n\nexport default Index;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
