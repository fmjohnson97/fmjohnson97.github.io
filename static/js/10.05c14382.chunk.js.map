In this work, we explore the use of feudal\n        networks, used in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), to devise a\n        vehicle agent to predict steering angles from first person, dash-cam images\n        of the Udacity driving dataset. Our method,Feudal Steering, is inspired by\n        recent work in HRL consisting of a manager network and a worker network that\n        operate on different temporal scales and have different goals. The manager works\n        at a temporal scale that is relatively coarse compared to the worker and has a\n        higher level, task-oriented goal space. Using feudal learning to divide the task into\n        manager and worker sub-networks provides more accurate and robust prediction. Temporal\n        abstraction in driving allows more complex primitives than the steering angle at a single\n        time instance. Composite actions comprise a subroutine or skill that can be re-used\n        throughout the driving sequence. The associated subroutine id is the manager network’s\n        goal, so that the manager seeks to succeed at the high level task (e.g. a sharp right\n        turn, a slight right turn, moving straight in traffic, or moving straight unencumbered\n        by traffic). The steering angle at a particular time instance is the worker network\n        output which is regulated by the manager’s high level task. We demonstrate\n        state-of-the art steering angle prediction results on the Udacity dataset.\n      </p>\n      <h1>Oral Presentation</h1>\n      <iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUbhBZTb3j4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen> </iframe>\n      <div> <p> </p></div>\n      <h1> Network </h1>\n      <img src={`${PUBLIC_URL}/images/publications/Sub_Angle_Diagram.png`} alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" />\n      <p>\n        This is our Feudal Steering network. The overall network is comprised of a manager\n        network and a worker network. The worker network (expanded in the red box) acts as\n        the steering angle prediction network. The input to the manager network is a sequence\n        of the previous m predicted steering angles, [a<sub>n−1−m</sub>, a<sub>n−1−(m−1)</sub>,\n        ..., a<sub>n−1</sub>]. The input to the worker network is a sequence of m frames,\n        [i<sub>n−m</sub>, i<sub>n−(m−1)</sub>, ..., i<sub>n</sub>], a goal,\n        g, obtained from the manager network, and the previous steering angle, a<sub>n−1</sub>.\n        The yellow box represents the ELU (exponential linear unit) and group normalization step\n        in the pipeline.\n      </p>\n      <div> <p> </p></div>\n      <h1> t-SNE Embedding as Subroutine ID </h1>\n      <img src={`${PUBLIC_URL}/images/publications/TSNE_Multi_photo_example.jpeg`} alt=\"\" width=\"75%\" />\n      <p>\n        Example training images are shown with their corresponding t-SNE centroids. Notice the\n        bottom right of the figure contains sharp right turns. Moving upwards and to the left,\n        the right turn gets less sharp until the vehicle begins to go straight. Eventually this\n        straight behavior starts to become a left turn until the vehicle is making sharp left\n        turns in the upper left hand corner.\n      </p>\n      <img src={`${PUBLIC_URL}/images/publications/clusterVerification.png`} alt=\"\" width=\"60%\" />\n      <p>\n        The left column of images are a subset of centroid frames from the previous image.
